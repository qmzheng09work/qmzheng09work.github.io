## Understanding the Urban-Climate-Environment nexus with geospatial data, model, and ML/AI techniques. 

### Topic 1: Nighttime Light Remote Sensing

**1. Impact of temporal compositing on nighttime light data and its applications**   
  We utilized over 180,000 daily NTL tiles from NASA’s Black Marble VIIRS product (VNP46A2, 2012–2020), covering 230 cities from China and the United States, to delve    into the influence of temporal compositing on valid pixel coverage and spatiotemporal pattern of NTL data and the performance of three representative types of NTL-based applications.

### Topic 2: Understanding global urbanization for sustainable urban developing   

**1. Characterizing urban land changes of 30 global megacities using nighttime light time series stacks**    
  We proposed a methodology framework to characterize diverse urban land changes of 30 global megacities using monthly nighttime light time series from VIIRS data. Urban land changes occurred in 51% of the built-up pixels of the megacities. Compared with urban growth, other types of urban land change, particularly land use intensification, contributed to an unexpectedly large proportion of the changes (83%).
